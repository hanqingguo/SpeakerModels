How to run this?

First:
run:
vad/silence-removal-master/train_test_list.py 
to get:
Train Pool:
	speaker 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
	randomly choose 5 utterances from each speaker as train set.
	the rest 20 utterances from each speaker as test set.
Test Pool:
	speaker 11,12,13,14
	randomly choose 3 utterances from each speaker as enroll
	the rest 22 utterances from each speaker as verification

Run speaker_id.py with given .cfg file.
The cfg file will has information of network structure, and train set, test set.

After running speaker_id.py, it will generate model.pkl file.

Run compute_d_vector.py with given enroll.scp and verification.scp seperately.
Then it will load model.pkl and generate d_vec_enroll.npy and d_vec_verification.npy

Run computeEER.py with given d_vec_enroll.npy and d_vec_verification.npy
